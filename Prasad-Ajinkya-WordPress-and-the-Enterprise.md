Speaker Notes Template for WordCamp Mumbai 2015

##Prasad Ajinkya - 13 Llama Studio.

In the past couple of years, WordPress is being used more as an app development platform and less as a blog or CMS. 

This talk is aimed at WordPress developers as well as Business owners who are considering WordPress as part of their enterprise stack.

PS - The first couple of slides are a homage to Leonard Nemoy (Spock)! Couldn't resist the urge to use the Piccard meme as well ;-)
