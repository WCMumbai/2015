Hello there,

## If you are a speaker...
Want to add notes here? Create a file like - `firstname-lastname-talk-name-with-dashes-instead-of-spaces.md`

**Example**

A session by "Derp Derpavkar" with title "Starting a WordPress Blog" should have a file name as below:

```
derp-derpavkar-starting-wordPress-blog.md
```

** Instructions **
- Copy over the template.md file and use it as a starting point. (recommended)
- If you wish to add code then please create a directory for yourself with the naming convention specified above and use a README.md file inside it to share notes.


## If you are WordCamper...
You are in the right place! Check the notes for a talk by clicking on the respective `.md` file or directory in folder: [https://github.com/WordCampMum/2015] . :)
