# Official Repo for WordCamp Mumbai 2015

Hello there,

## If you are a speaker... 
Want to add notes here? Create a file like - `firstnamelastname-talkname.md`

`For eg. Derp Derpavkar - Starting a WordPress Blog`
- Copy over the template.md file and use it as a starting point. (recommended)
- If you wish to add code then please create a directory for yourself with the naming convention specified above and use a README.md file inside it to share notes.


## If you are WordCamper...
You are in the right place! Check the notes for a talk by clicking on the respective `.md` file. :)
