# Typography for WordPress

 It doesn't make sense to mention all the links on the slides, as they're not clickable there! As a result, this GitHub file was born where I'll try and mention my personal recommendations and all the links I find useful.

------------------------------------------------------------

Alrighty, as I mentioned in the talk, I always prefer to pair 2 fonts together which go well with each other. Use a `sans-serif` font for all the headings (h1, h2, etc.) and a `serif` font for the body text OR vice versa. Use monospaced fonts for displaying code. Experiment with various combinations until you find one which makes you (and your readers) happy :wink:

### Sans-serif fonts I recommend:
 - [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans)
 - [Raleway](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway) (especially recommended for headings)
 - [Lato](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato)
 - [PT Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Sans)
 - [Montserrat](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat) (especially recommended for headings)


### Sans-serif fonts I DON'T recommend:
 - Helvetica
 - Arial

Some of you might disagree with this, and it's okay. But I believe there are much better fonts out there compared to these two. Don't settle for mediocrity.

### Serif fonts I recommend:
  - Georgia
  - [Crimson Text](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Crimson+Text)
  - [Cardo](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Cardo)
  - [Sorts Mill Goudy](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Sorts+Mill+Goudy) (especially recommended for headings)


### Monospaced fonts I recommend:
  - [Source code pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) (this is *the* best)
  - [PT Mono](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Mono)

------------------------------------------------------------

So those were my recommendations. Now if you remember, I talked about three CSS properties in the session:
 - [font-family](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-family.asp)
 - [font-size](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-size.asp)
 - [line-height](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_line-height.asp)


If you want even more control, here are some CSS properties which will help you in your typography:
 - [letter-spacing](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_letter-spacing.asp)
 - [font-style](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-style.asp)
 - [font-weight](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_weight.asp)
 - [text-align](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-align.asp) (never set it to `justified`, seriously!)

------------------------------------------------------------

### Get fonts from here:

 - [Google fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) for free web fonts
 - [Typography.com](http://www.typography.com/) for paid fonts
 - [Typekit.com](https://typekit.com/) for paid fonts (they also offer free ones)

### Here are some *really* useful links:

 - [CSS font stack](http://www.cssfontstack.com/) for checking web-safe fonts
 - [Golden ratio typography calculator](http://pearsonified.com/typography/)
 - [WP Google Fonts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-google-fonts/) - plugin for adding Google fonts to your site
 - [WhatFont](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en) - chrome extension for checking fonts on all websites
 

And finally, if you wanna dig deeper into typography, here's a kickass post series to get you started: [A-Z of Web Typography](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/a-z-of-web-typography--webdesign-11706) by tutsplus.

P.S: GitHub needs to work on its typography as well! :sweat_smile:
